    # The issue is that some methods are missing return type annotations
    # But these have already been fixed
]

# Fix 2: Fix issues in pre_deployment_validators.py
# The main issues seem to be:
# 1. Some function returning dict when it should return str
# 2. Type mismatches in assignments
# 3. Default argument issues

# Since I can't pinpoint the exact issues from the line numbers,
# let me check the common patterns that might need fixing

print("\nSince the exact line numbers don't match the code, the errors might be:")

print("1. Run mypy directly to get fresh error locations")
print("2. Fix each error based on the actual code at those lines")
print("3. Add proper type annotations where missing")
